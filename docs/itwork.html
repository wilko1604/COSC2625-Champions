		<p><b>What do you do with your profession?  What kind of work is done by your profession?</b></p>
		<p>starting off with the fact that my job title is systems manager and moment what's involved with that is basically the implementation design Administration and continued support of critical infrastructure systems for my business, which is an outdoor advertising company specializing in digital outdoor.</p>
		
		<p><b>What kind of people do interact with through your work like any other it professionals clients investors and or the general public?</b></p>
		<p>I'd say that mostly I interact with internal stakeholders. They usually people in my department, which is the operations Department frequently though. I chat with other key investors from within my company such as the sales team the Commercials/concessions Department various representatives of different partner companies I work with like That's the word from Distributors of one for hardware and software support teens and developers from different companies that I have contracted with to create things for me or given briefs or done Partnerships with as well as I can't door Adam company ones like advertising partners and clients. I also have to deal with them whenever there are issues and they want like a tech consultant in regards to an issue that we've been having. Different ones mostly internal stakeholders, but a lot of external stakeholders.</p>
		
		<p><b>Whereabouts in your job do you spend the most time? Like what are the tasks are you doing most often?</b></p>
		<p>At the moment now that I've been promoted to systems manager given that I've had two promotions starting off as networks for the promoted to senior Network support them. Right assistance manager. Most of my day really tasks involve the continued administration of current systems. I take single-handed responsibility for all of our remote monitoring. I take Zinger responsibility for a lot of the high-level resolution of issues across the network. Example of one that I'm dealing with at the moment is that half of the computers that I have an ad in the field screens. There's a software issue with the software that plays the ads on the screens and most of the computers on the network are communicating the software which means that they won't be getting new ads and they won't be reporting back on ads that are playing. So that's like a really high land issue that could actually fuck up the entire company for lack of a better word. That's the type of stuff that I deal with. I put out fires in regards to huge infrastructure issues. And then I just keep the ship running on a day-to-day basis, mostly. </p>
		
		<p><b>So and my final question is what aspect of your position is the most challenging?</b></p>
		<p>So itâ€™d be  50/50 between the most challenging technical stuff, especially when I'm dealing with software projects and in processes that I've not encountered before having to learn new things to fulfil a brief that executive or some Partners given us having to deal with something never done before can be very difficult. It's often very challenging and rewarding but it is difficult and the other half Is just dealing with stakeholders. Sometimes people hold you to a higher level of service. Then we're capable of delivering and that represents its own challenges. Sometimes they want you diligence that are companies that willing to spend the money to provide. So I end up having to negotiate and deal with the client directly from like a customer service flash sales point of view. Sometimes I end up doing that and that's not something that I'm particularly is not meant to be part of my job. Job, as I particularly well trained in but I do find myself doing that a lot. So that's basically it I'd say half the time it's the really difficult technicians and halftime is a really difficult clients.</p>
		
		<p><b>How was your journey getting into the IT world post-uni? What was it like for you?</b></p>
		<p>I graduated I don't even remember. I graduated after spending a year and a half getting several different certifications including my diploma a lot of different relative certifications not just academic ones as well. And then I spend the next nine months unable to find an entry-level position in Perth owing to the fact that it was particularly hard marketing than the time. It continues to be a particularly hard Market the entry-level it people. I wish I could say that I after nine months. I found a solution but honestly, didn't I move to Melbourne and I decided that I start studying again just to keep myself busy because I'm literally couldn't find a job and then eventually gave that ends up looking for a job in Melbourne and Fan One within a month. So I'm basically graduated then spent ten months of my life looking for work and unable to find it. Okay since stuff that's very encouraging for when I finish. Well, thank you for all those and You want to like the simplest way I could put two. Self apart when you're applying for the angel jobs and one probably got me through with this one as opposed to others I interviewed for is that everyone wants to see very confident communicators. That's arguably more important in technical skill is being able to articulate and document problems correctly and be able to talk to and interact with stakeholders. If you can't do that properly and you're not someone somewhat eloquent. You end up just as you know like a Code Monkey type of grinder in terms of the business. But if you can prove that you can communicate properly get that across in the interview and your resume people like that idea very high it looked upon and they are the reason that is the reason that they get promotions or months as opposed to their peers, which is why I got promoted twice. Wonderful. Thank you very much for your time. I'm going to end the recording now, that was absolutely wonderful</p>

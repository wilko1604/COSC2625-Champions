		<p>My name is Fissehatsiyon Abate. My friends call me Fisseha, as my full name is apparently excessively lengthy and somewhat difficult to pronounce, according to them. I was born in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. I grew up there until the age of 12 before coming to Australia in late 2014. I can fluently speak two of the eighty languages in Ethiopia. Those I speak are Amharic and Ge'ez. The first five years of my stay in Australia were in Adelaide, South Australia. I recently moved to Melbourne with my family after completing Highschool. I have so far enjoyed the couple of months that I have been here in Victoria. As most Ethiopians are, I am a big follower of Soccer. Although I do not do much playing these days, I passionately support Manchester United F.C. which is a club in England's top soccer league. I also do a lot of drawing and painting in my spare time which I at one-point thought was going to be the career I would pursue. Even though I have not done a lot of artwork, I still consider myself an artist. One rather interesting fact about myself is that I'm one of the 5% of the world's population who does not experience headaches.</p>

An interesting fact about me is that i can speak around 4 languages Hindi, Urdu, English, and Punjabi. I have completed grade 5 in India and then continued my studies in Australia. I completed year 12 last year, and now I am studying Bachelors of Information Technology, at RMIT.

		<p>My name is Fissehatsiyon Abate. My friends call me Fisseha, as my full name is apparently excessively lengthy and somewhat difficult to pronounce, according to them. I was born in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. I grew up there until the age of 12 before coming to Australia in late 2014. I can fluently speak two of the eighty languages in Ethiopia. Those I speak are Amharic and Ge'ez. The first five years of my stay in Australia were in Adelaide, South Australia. I recently moved to Melbourne with my family after completing Highschool. I have so far enjoyed the couple of months that I have been here in Victoria. As most Ethiopians are, I am a big follower of Soccer. Although I do not do much playing these days, I passionately support Manchester United F.C. which is a club in England's top soccer league. I also do a lot of drawing and painting in my spare time which I at one-point thought was going to be the career I would pursue. Even though I have not done a lot of artwork, I still consider myself an artist. One rather interesting fact about myself is that I'm one of the 5% of the world's population who does not experience headaches.</p>

           My name is Aisha Begum, I am from India. We migrated to Australia when I was 10 years old, at home we usually speak in Hindi. An interesting fact about me is that i can speak around 4 languages Hindi, Urdu, English, and Punjabi. I have completed grade 5 in India and then continued my studies in Australia. I completed year 12 last year, and now I am studying Bachelors of Information Technology, at RMIT. I choose to study IT because of my passion for learning about the way the computer system works and how it allows us to work effectively.

        <p> This Home Security System works simple, this system recognises the users with their fingerprints and their voices they will have to be registered before they can have access to the system. The doors do not have handles and the user do not need to carry a key to be able to unlock the door, the user can unlock using their fingerprints. After entering they can also be recognised as they speak for example if they would like to check the cameras all they have to say is “Access Cameras” and the system will automatically turn on the TV and you would be able to check the cameras, this could be accessed in many different languages. </p>
        
        <p>To able to allow guests to enter the house, any registered members could say “Grant Access” to allow them to enter the house or they can scan their fingers from inside the house and the door will open. However, before opening the door the system will scan if a person is safe to enter you will hear “Access Granted” after scanning has completed and the door will open (this would take about 20 – 30 sec) however if they are carrying any sort of weapons or are unsafe you will hear  “Access Denied” and the alarm will be turned on automatically after 20 seconds meanwhile the system would show you why it has blocked access, however, if you think it’s an error and you would like the person to enter you would be able to allow access from inside the house by stopping the alarm and giving access. </p>
            
        <p> While Parents are away they can check on their children easily just by texting on the security app which will be linked to the security system all they have to do is to text “what is everyone in the house doing” the application would reply by checking the sensors that are in use for example “ they are 5 people in the house 2 people are detected in the study room and the rest of them are in the living room. </p>
            
        <p>Parents can also give a message to all their children present in the house at once they do not have to individually call each one of them to inform them. On the app they can message saying “a message for family” and then they can either video record, audio record or just text (the system will read it out to everyone). An example for video/audio message “A message from ___ playing audio/video” for a text is “___ has sent a message saying “……”” the listeners can re-listen to a message as many time as they want, messages will be deleted after 24 hours a message could be saved by any registered member using the app, they will have private access to the message.  </p>
            
        <p>The likely problems users may face are caused due to loss of power and Wi-Fi, as the system is electronic we need to make sure that the users can enter and exit the house in any circumstances, the huge concern is to make sure that only registered members can enter even if there is no power. As the system can't work during a power outage, we concluded that a Backup Battery is the best option for the user to continue using the app, as it will provide power to the system when the primary source of power is unavailable.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, the problems user could face may include registering newborn, people with disabilities, and people with special needs into the system, this could be solved by providing the users to use other biometric Authentication such as voice recognition and face recognition. Newborn could be registered as a dependent under parents or other registered members, the dependant users will have to enter and exit the house with an independent user.
